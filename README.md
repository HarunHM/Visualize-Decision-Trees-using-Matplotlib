# Visualize-Decision-Trees-using-Matplotlib

As of scikit-learn version 21.0, from  May 2019, Decision Trees can now be plotted with matplotlib using scikit-learnâ€™s tree.plot_tree without relying on the dot library which is a hard-to-install dependency which we will cover later on in the blog post.

<p> The code below plots a decision tree using scikit-learn. </p>

<code> tree.plot_tree(clf); </code>
